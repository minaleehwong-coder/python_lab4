Reflection:
Encapsulation made it easier to recall repeated functions. However, fixing the stem for one example did not work for all pumpkin calls.

Generalization: by calling different pumpkin location and size we realized it wasn't a generalized function yet. Had to make sure turtle was facing same direction for every function to make it predictable. Debugging turtle location can be very tedious. 

I managed to get it to work by adjusting the numbers and running it over and over again. I am sure there is a better way to do it by using variables and calculations instead of using absolute values.
